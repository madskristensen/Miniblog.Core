  <content>&lt;p&gt;I know that the Test Driven Development series is lagging behind schedule a bit, but this weekend I decided to move the site from a shared hosting provider to a virtual private server. What a weekend it was. Hats off to all of the server administrators out there that do such great jobs at keeping the worlds servers online. I won't blog about the experience b/c it's just typical IT mambo jumbo, but hopefully I will be done in a couple of days and can upload the remaining content for the series. I have about six more sites to transfer, but they all require databases so I am moving fast to get Microsoft SQL Server installed and configured.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, happy coding, will blog again soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
