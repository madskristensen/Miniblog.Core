  <content>&lt;p&gt;This is my first post using Miniblog.Core developed by Mads Kristensen. I migrated over from Ghost because I wanted more simple upgrade experience. Given that I host my blog on Microsoft Azure and I am a .NET developer, I will be able to make updates as often and as rapidly as I desire or at least as Microsoft upgrades Azure itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more importantly, the integration with Open Live Writer is a huge plus because I can compose blog posts with layout and images using a familiar editor and retain those blog posts locally.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
